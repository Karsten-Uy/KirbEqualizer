# KirbEqualizer

Description:

This project utilizer the juce framework to create a versatile audio equalizer with highpass, lowpass, and peak filters, allowing users to tailor the audio output according to their preferences. The equalizer includes a user-friendly interface to manipulate filter parameters, such as cutoff frequencies, Q values, and gain, providing fine-grained control over the audio signal.

Features:

Highpass Filter:

Adjustable cutoff frequency to control the lower limit of the frequency spectrum.
User-defined slope for the filter to customize the roll-off characteristics.
Lowpass Filter:

Configurable cutoff frequency to determine the upper limit of the frequency spectrum.
User-selectable slope for the filter to adjust the roll-off behaviour.
Peak Filter:

Center frequency adjustment for targeting specific frequencies.
User-defined bandwidth (Q value) to control the range of affected frequencies.
Gain control to boost or attenuate the selected frequency.
Output Gain:

Global output gain control to adjust the overall volume level.
Visual representation of the response curve to provide real-time feedback on the applied equalization.
Response Curve Visualization:

Graphical representation of the frequency response curve to help users visualize the applied equalization.
Real-time updating of the response curve as filter parameters are adjusted.
